# Rimworld-Roomba
This is a mod I'm working on to make a craftable Roomba in Rimworld to help clean your large bases. 


# TODO

- Make Roomba craftable(AI Core maybe? although IRL not that advanced, component, steel(maybe plasteel to make it more endgame))

- Set Roomba as a Pawn(Don't know if it is possible to craft a pawn)
- Allow setting areas for Roomba to clean
- Add Energy need
